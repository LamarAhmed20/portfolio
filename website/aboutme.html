            <p class="idk">I am Lamar Ahmed from Alexandria, Egypt</p>
    <p>I am 14 years old and currently still studying in Ischool. I live in Kuwait. My goal 
      is to earn a Master's Degree in a good college. I find programming very fun because every task I have to do is 
      a new skill I learn which is a step closer to being a better programmer. I play games like Valorant and Call of 
      Duty and I spend my time learning more about computers. I think people should work with me because I'm hardworking
      and always up for a challenge!
